Define an 1-d array of length 1000. With all entries containing the value 0. Except for one entry (choose it to be any entry between 100-900). This entry would contain the value 1.. Now itâ€™s like a game. Suppose the 600th entry is chosen to have 1. Then now after one iteration either 599th entry or the 601st entry will also become 1..... This is completely random ...each time it can be the entry before it or after it... Now you completely randomly choose two entries and swap the values contained in them.. And repeat the steps I said till now.. After each iteration count the number of entries which contain the value 1..... Using matplotlib plot the number of iteration (x axis) and number of entries with value 1 (y axis)
